                            <h2>Where It <span>Started</span></h2>
                            <p>In 1997, at just 17 years old, Aaron Kenn (our founding chairman, affectionately known as
                                THE BIG BIRD) began his career in a small publishing house. Driven by a deep passion for
                                books and their transformative power, Aaron dedicated himself to learning and mastering
                                the world of authorship. Over the years, he worked with various book writing and
                                publishing firms, striving to establish himself as a prominent name in the industry.
                                While working full-time, Aaron earned a degree in Economics from the London School of
                                Economics, and he led significant teams of editors, publishers, and marketers. His
                                expertise not only helped authors brainstorm and craft their works but also played a
                                crucial role in marketing them effectively.</p>
                            <p>The first decade of Aaron’s career was both inspiring and foundational. It supported his
                                decision to leave his job and start his own venture, driven by a vision to have more
                                time and control to serve his clients, whom he considered family. Aaron also assisted
                                many friends and family members in successfully writing and publishing their own books.
                                This growing recognition as an industry leader led to the creation of the first
                                iteration of The Author Nest (HOBs), which began as a class for aspiring authors
                                dreaming of writing their own books.</p>

                            <h2>Changing <span>Lives</span></h2>
                            <p>Later that year, Kenn’s life was profoundly affected by a tragic event. His close
                                friend’s young daughter, Lisa, just 9 years old, passed away suddenly during a
                                family vacation. This heartbreaking loss left Kenn grappling with deep grief and a
                                new perspective on the fragility of life. In his struggle to cope, Kenn felt a
                                powerful urge to honor Lisa’s memory by achieving what she would never have the
                                chance to.</p>
                            <p>While sorting through Lisa’s belongings, Kenn discovered a journal filled with her
                                enchanting drawings and whimsical stories. It was clear that Lisa, inspired by
                                Kenn’s own journey as a writer, had started crafting her own magical tales. Although
                                the book was compiled for friends and family and never published, its impact on
                                their small community was profound. The stories and memories of Lisa left a lasting
                                imprint on Kenn, helping him channel his grief into a meaningful endeavor.</p>
                            <p>The powerful effect of Lisa’s stories on readers made Kenn realize the profound
                                potential of a book to preserve a legacy and touch lives. This insight ignited a
                                deep passion within him. Inspired by Lisa’s stories, Kenn, along with his visionary
                                co-founders, established “HOBs” (The Author Nest) - a one-window solution for
                                authors. HOBs provides comprehensive services including writing, editing, printing,
                                marketing, and audiobooks.</p>
                            <p>Kenn’s journey, driven by his desire to honor Lisa and his personal transformation,
                                gave him a renewed sense of purpose. Through HOBs, he now finds fulfillment in
                                guiding others through every step of the publishing process, ensuring that every
                                story—no matter how small—can leave a lasting impact on the world. By turning
                                personal tragedies into a beacon of hope and inspiration, Kenn is committed to
                                helping others create their own legacies, just as Lisa’s stories continue to inspire
                                and uplift those who remember her.</p>
