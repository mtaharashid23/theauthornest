                        <p><img src="img/complete-guid-1.webp" alt="book editor frustrated"></p>
                        <p>
                            So, you've got a book in the works. Or maybe there's a brilliant idea bouncing around in
                            your mind, but you haven't quite started writing yet.
                            Perhaps the daunting thought of navigating the traditional publishing maze is holding you
                            back, because, let's face it, it can be a real hassle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, you need to land an agent, and then that agent has to connect you with publishers.
                            After months, or sometimes even years, of meetings and rejections,
                            you might finally secure a publishing deal. But what if there was an easier option? A more
                            straightforward path. What if you could <em>publish it yourself?</em>
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="sub-2">What Self-Publishing Really Means</h3>
                        <p><img src="img/complete-guid-2.webp" alt="attractive book cover design"></p>
                        <p>
                            But hold on, what exactly is self-publishing? The days of publishers holding all the power
                            are long gone. Now, the control is in the hands of the author, and you can use this to your
                            full advantage. In simple terms, self-publishing means you're cutting out the middlemen and
                            taking your work directly to the readers, all on your own.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you think it's a wild idea, consider this: about 1.7 million books are self-published
                            each year, with many achieving remarkable success. Christopher Paolini turned his love for
                            fantasy into the best-selling Inheritance Cycle and even scored a major movie deal. Rupi
                            Kaur, the renowned poet behind <em>Milk and Honey</em>, which topped the New York Times
                            Bestseller list for 77 weeks, also began her journey through self-publishing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But self-publishing doesn't mean just printing your book and handing it out on street
                            corners. There's a process to follow, and in this guide, we'll take you through each step
                            until you can proudly call yourself a published author.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="sub-3">Choose Your Genre, Any Genre</h3>
                        <p>
                            Seems like a no-brainer, right? But you'd be amazed at how often people rush ahead without a
                            clear plan. As simple as it may sound, writing your first book is no walk in the park. It
                            demands time and dedication, so you'll want to kick things off with a solid concept, a seed
                            that will grow into the foundation of your entire book.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Are you leaning toward genre fiction? Maybe you're itching to create the next big sci-fi
                            sensation? Or perhaps you have grander ambitions that steer you toward literary fiction?
                            Maybe you're a true romantic and dream of crafting a timeless love story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And who says you have to stick to fiction? Non-fiction is a fantastic choice for first-time
                            authors, especially if you're more into research than storytelling. In fact, it's one of the
                            most profitable genres out there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Take Brad Aronson, for example. Moved by his wife's battle with leukemia, he penned
                            <em>Humankind</em>, a book celebrating the power of kindness in a world that often seems
                            harsh. Brad's book became a bestseller, and he's not the only one who found success this
                            way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            William Cowan turned his thirty years in the corporate world into <em>Building a Winning
                                Career</em>, Andrew Griffiths captured his 35 years of entrepreneurial wisdom in
                            <em>Someone Has to Be the Most Expensive</em>, and James Altucher's <em>Choose
                                Yourself!</em> spread his self-investment philosophy to wide acclaim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These authors hit it big and topped bestseller lists with non-fiction. You can do it too!

                        <h3 id="sub-4">Time to Start Writing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being a writer isn't easy, not by a long shot. It's almost cliché how often writers hit a
                            wall, and the closer you get to finishing your book, the tougher it can be to push through
                            to the end. To help you stay on track, here are some key Do's and Don'ts to keep in mind.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Do's:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>DO stick to a routine:</strong> Writing can feel like a grind sometimes, but it
                            becomes much more manageable when you do it consistently. There's no one-size-fits-all
                            approach here—some people thrive in the morning, while others find their groove as the sun
                            sets. Find what works for you, but whatever you choose, make sure that time is dedicated
                            solely to writing. Doing anything else can break your flow, and once that's gone, it's tough
                            to get it back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>DO set a deadline:</strong> This is crucial, especially if you're self-publishing!
                            Having a deadline looming can push you to work faster, even if you're only holding yourself
                            accountable. A solid approach is to aim for a chapter a week or set a goal of 500 to 1,000
                            words per day—whatever feels doable for you. This gives you a target to aim for, and
                            reaching it will give you a boost of satisfaction and motivation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>DO keep a notebook handy:</strong> Inspiration can strike at any moment, so it's
                            wise to be prepared. A little notebook can be a game-changer for your writing speed. It's a
                            space where you can jot down ideas and interesting things you encounter throughout your day,
                            so when it's time to write, you can dive right in without searching for inspiration.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Don'ts:</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>DON'T edit as you go:</strong> It's easy to get caught up in the details, but that's
                            a surefire way to slow yourself down. Obsessing over every word can disrupt your focus and
                            give your inner critic too much control. Don't let the pursuit of perfection get in the way
                            of progress. Let the words flow and save the fine-tuning for later.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>DON'T overcommit:</strong> No one's expecting you to churn out hundreds of books
                            like Isaac Asimov (although that would be impressive!). The goal is to finish what you
                            start, and if writing something shorter or simpler helps, then go for it! Of course, that
                            doesn't mean you should limit yourself, but don't take on more than you can handle.
                            Finishing a draft will motivate you to tackle bigger projects, whereas abandoning one can
                            drain your energy and enthusiasm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>DON'T lose focus:</strong> Easier said than done, right? But staying focused is
                            essential, especially in our distraction-filled world. Here are a few time management
                            strategies that might help:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Break your writing time into 25-minute
                                    chunks, followed by a 5-minute break, and take a longer 15-minute break after every
                                    four intervals. You can use an app to help with this and adjust the intervals to
                                    suit your preferences.</li>
                                <li><strong>Time Blocking:</strong> Set aside specific blocks of time for writing,
                                    research, or any other tasks related to your project. When you're in your writing
                                    zone, stay focused—no checking your phone, no answering emails, just writing,
                                    researching, or editing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Create a Writing Space:</strong> Whether it's a whole room or a cozy nook,
                                    having a dedicated space for your writing can make a big difference. No phones, no
                                    distractions—just you and your work. A bulletin board for ideas can be a helpful
                                    addition, too.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="sub-5">Editing</h3>
                            <p>
                                Once you've wrapped up your first draft and celebrated that big milestone, it's time to
                                shape it into its final form. Don't stress if you spot a bunch of errors—that's exactly
                                what
                                editing is for!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are four key stages of editing that you'll need to work through. Let's break them
                                down:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Developmental Editing:</strong> This is the first step in the editing
                                    process,
                                    focusing on the heart of your story. Does it all make sense? Are there any plot
                                    holes or
                                    loose ends you didn't mean to leave hanging? Pay close attention to how your
                                    characters
                                    develop, and ensure the themes stay consistent throughout your draft.</li>
                                <li><strong>Line Editing:</strong> With the big picture sorted, it's time to dive into
                                    the
                                    details. Go through your manuscript line by line, checking for any issues with flow
                                    or
                                    coherence. Don't hesitate to tweak sentences or adjust transitions—it's all part of
                                    refining your book to make it the best it can be.</li>
                                <li><strong>Copy Editing:</strong> By now, your story should be solid and flowing
                                    smoothly.
                                    But what about those pesky punctuation errors? Grammatical slips? Formatting
                                    glitches?
                                    During copy editing, you'll focus on these kinds of issues and also double-check for
                                    factual accuracy, especially if you're working on non-fiction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Finally, we reach the last stage of editing! This is
                                    where you give your draft one final, thorough read to catch anything you might have
                                    missed. Once you're done, you're all set!</li>

                                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Editing can be just as draining as writing, so it might be a
                                good
                                idea to bring in a fresh set of eyes. While there's nothing wrong with editing your own
                                work, having someone else do it can reduce the chances of mistakes slipping through.

                                It all begins with the page layout, which might not sound super exciting, but that's the
                                idea—it shouldn't be noticeable. If someone's paying attention to the layout, it's
                                likely
                                disrupting readability! To make sure your draft looks polished and professional, here
                                are
                                some key typesetting tips to follow:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Font:</strong> The font you choose depends a lot on your genre. Non-fiction
                                    usually calls for something straightforward and serious, while fiction gives you
                                    more
                                    room to get creative. Fonts like Garamond or Centaur work well. For body text, stick
                                    with a font size between 11 to 12 points, with a minimum of 7 points.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chapter Headers:</strong> You might have to keep it simple with body text
                                    fonts,
                                    but feel free to get a little more creative with chapter headings. Adding some flair
                                    at
                                    the start of each chapter can be a nice touch, but don't overthink it. If you're
                                    stuck,
                                    just bold your regular font for the headings and move on.</li>
                                <li><strong>Paragraph Format:</strong> Indent each paragraph about 0.2 inches from the
                                    left,
                                    except for the first one, which usually isn't indented. Justified text gives your
                                    book a
                                    more polished look, especially for ebooks, as it helps with the flow. If justified
                                    text
                                    causes awkward line breaks, don't hesitate to hyphenate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Page and Line Breaks:</strong> Watch out for widows and orphans, but not the
                                    kind you're thinking of! In formatting, a widow is the last line of a paragraph that
                                    ends up on the next page, and an orphan is the first line of a paragraph that lands
                                    on
                                    the previous page. Get rid of them to enhance readability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Your text should fit neatly within a "book block," a
                                    well-defined area in the center of the page. For printed books, lines on facing
                                    pages
                                    should align perfectly. When formatting an ebook, avoid adding extra spacing before
                                    or
                                    after lines and paragraphs—keep it set to 0 points, with single line spacing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Margins:</strong> There are four margins to keep in mind: top, outside,
                                    bottom,
                                    and gutter. The top and bottom are self-explanatory; the outside margin is the outer
                                    edge of the page, and the gutter margin is the space between the book block and the
                                    binding. If your book includes images or designs, consider the bleed—this is the
                                    part of
                                    the image that extends beyond the page's edge to ensure a clean trim. Books with
                                    bleeds
                                    need outside margins of at least 0.375 inches, while those without can have 0.25
                                    inches.
                                    Gutter margins vary depending on the book's length, ranging from 0.375 inches for
                                    shorter books to 0.875 inches for longer ones.</li>
                                <li><strong>Trim Size:</strong> The standard size for printed books is 6x9 inches. You
                                    can
                                    go larger if you like, but keep in mind that this might increase printing costs.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Tools like Scrivener or Vellum can be a lifesaver when it comes
                                to
                                formatting. Work smarter, not harder!</p>

                                It's no secret that people do judge a book by its cover, and most readers are guilty of
                                it.
                                Many authors have seen their sales skyrocket simply by updating their cover design.

                                <li><strong>Martin Lake:</strong> The author of the "Lost King" series saw his sales
                                    jump
                                    from just a few dozen to hundreds after giving his cover a makeover.</li>
                                <li><strong>D.F. Hart:</strong> His mystery thriller series had a best sales month of
                                    only
                                    167 units. But after a cover redesign that clearly communicated the genre, he
                                    managed to
                                    sell over 7,500 units.</li>

                                Don't wait until the last minute to think about your book's cover. It's a crucial part
                                of
                                the process, so it's better to tackle it early on.

                                So, how should you approach designing your book cover? It's taken you months, maybe even
                                years, to reach this point, so you definitely want to get this right. Your cover should
                                accurately reflect the content of your book. If you're writing non-fiction, avoid the
                                temptation to plaster your face on the cover. There's a fine line between self-promotion
                                and
                                vanity! Take a page from Robin Sharma's book. The author of "The 5 AM Club" chose a
                                cover
                                that perfectly captured the essence of his book without giving too much away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As you write, try jotting down ideas for your cover. Did any visual elements stand out?
                                Is
                                there something that captures the core of your book? Fiction writers might consider
                                featuring a couple of characters on the cover, like in Legends and Lattes by Travis
                                Baldree,
                                or opt for something more symbolic, like The Twisted Tree by Rachel Burge.

                                While you could design the cover yourself, especially if you want full control, there
                                comes
                                a time when it's better to hand the reins to someone with more experience. There's a

                                These days, finding a self-publishing platform is easy, but picking the right one? That
                                takes a bit more thought. Here are three important factors to consider:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Royalties and Costs:</strong> How much of the profits will you actually see?
                                    Are
                                    printing costs included, or are they an extra charge? These are key questions to
                                    ask.
                                    Take the time to compare options until you find a platform that suits your needs.
                                    Keep
                                    in mind that lower royalties aren't always a deal breaker—they might come with
                                    benefits
                                    like more control over where and how your book is sold, which brings us to the next

                                <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) offers higher
                                    royalty rates, but it ties you to their platform. On the flip side, IngramSpark
                                    gives
                                    you a smaller cut per book, but you get the freedom to choose which retailers carry
                                    your
                                    book.</li>

                                    to cover design—basically, all the services you might need beyond writing. Make sure
                                    the
                                    platform you choose offers an author profile, complete with your bio, photo, and

                                    media, now's the time to get started. Engage with journalists and critics on
                                    Twitter,
                                    join writing communities on Reddit, and seek endorsements from influencers on
                                    Instagram!
                                    Your marketing plan should cover everything from tweets to short-form videos, so
                                    consider creating a book trailer for YouTube and TikTok.</li>
                                <li><strong>Build an Author Website:</strong> Having a website adds credibility and
                                    gives
                                    readers a peek into the person behind the book. Don't forget to include a blog! The
                                    more
                                    platforms where you can share your writing, the better. Post occasional snippets
                                    from
                                    your book to entice readers into buying the full version.</li>
                                <li><strong>Don't Overlook Email Marketing:</strong> Include a call-to-action on your
                                    website inviting visitors to join your email list. This ensures they stay updated
                                    with
                                    your blog posts and snippets and are the first to know about your book launch.</li>
                                <li><strong>Get Your Book Reviewed:</strong> If people aren't sure what they're getting,
                                    they're less likely to make a purchase. There are plenty of ways to get reviews,
                                    starting with professional services and other third parties where you pay a fee for
                                    an
                                    honest critique of your book. But you don't always have to pay for reviews. Amazon
                                    Vine
                                    can help you get free reviews, and you can encourage readers to share their thoughts
                                    as
                                    well.</li>

                            <h3 id="sub-10">Book Launch and Distribution</h3>
                            <p>
                                You've made it to the final stretch! Your book is written, edited, reviewed, and
                                designed,
                                and you've chosen the perfect publishing platform. Now, you're ready to take that
                                monumental
                                first step into becoming a published author.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As exciting (and nerve-wracking) as this moment is, it's crucial to plan a solid launch
                                and
                                distribution strategy. Here's what you should focus on:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Maximize Distribution:</strong> Make sure your book is available across as
                                    many
                                    platforms as possible, both online and in physical stores. Consider Barnes
                                    and Noble, and IngramSpark to cover all bases. The right self-publishing platform
                                    will
                                    help you reach a wide range of bookstores. And don't forget to think
                                    globally—reaching
                                    an international audience can do wonders for your brand.</li>
                                <li><strong>Send Out a Newsletter:</strong> If you've been building your presence on
                                    social
                                    media and keeping your author website updated, you should have a loyal following
                                    ready
                                    for your book's release. Keep them in the loop with an email newsletter, and be sure
                                    to
                                    include links to where your book can be purchased.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ramp Up Your Marketing:</strong> Now's the time to go all out. Engage with
                                    influencers and journalists, and plan some in-person events like book readings,
                                    meet-and-greets, and community gatherings. A book launch party is a fantastic way to
                                    celebrate your big day and generate buzz. Don't forget to include book signings and
                                    a
                                    well-prepared speech to leave a lasting impression.</li>
                                <li><strong>Update Your Website:</strong> Your homepage should be fully geared up for
                                    the
                                    book launch. Highlight the cover, feature some early reviews, and add a new page
                                    listing
                                    upcoming events where you'll be promoting your book.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                One final tip: Think long-term. The moment your book is out there, you've already
                                achieved
                                something great! If your launch doesn't take off as expected, don't be discouraged—it
                                just
                                means you need more time to connect with your audience. Stay patient, keep pushing
                                forward,
                                and whatever you do, don't give up.
